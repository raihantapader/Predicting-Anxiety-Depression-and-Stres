# Predicting-Anxiety-Depression-and-Stress

Developed machine learning models to predict anxiety, depression, and stress among Bangladeshi university students using the “EDA + Predicting Mental Health” dataset, applying 11 algorithms across traditional, tree-based, probabilistic, and ensemble methods.

Achieved highest accuracy with CatBoost Classifier 95.15\% (anxiety), 93.88\% (depression), and 96.68\% (stress). , enhanced interpretability using Explainable AI (LIME), and employed voting techniques to improve prediction reliability for early detection of at-risk students.
